# Everlasting

Trello clone made in Angular 8 using arweave-js to manipulate the data. Based on https://github.com/Dunebook/Trelloclone. Not my idea, saw it on the arweave discord.

Alpha version: https://arweave.net/ZvXbJblZ1ME2DxMTJoXRFTwmxE1NITNWpbIvTFzpZsM.

Beta version: https://arweave.net/DXu5qFTHpr5WjByEkblCXORgS-COSXbnF4pYXCtQ2Co.
